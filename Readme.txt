Basic commands in Linux
lsb_release -a  ###to check the version of ubuntu
df -h    ##check the space
du -h /folder_name   ## check space of specific folder
du -sh *  ##to check the memory consumed by each folder (used mostly by me)
apt list --installed ## to check the list of installed applications
chmod 775 folder_name    ### to provide read, write and other permissions when the file creates
visudo           ##to add sudo usser for admin access""
cat /etc/passwd      ####path that shows the user app_name
cat /etc/shadow             ###########to know the shell and home folder

cat   ## to see the content int the file
cat auth.log | less   ##(to see page by page)
grep 'keyword" (to seach a specific word in the file)
cat file_name | grep 'search_word"
adduser User_name (to add a account)
sudo apt install app_name
sudo apt update
ls -a   ## to see the hidden files
find ~ -name "*your_filename*"  ### this will search for the fine_name in all paths

git branch  ( to check which branch you are)
git checkout -b branch_name
###access the ubuntu from windos (WSL install)
Windos + E and \\wsl$ to access linux

## access windows from ubuntu 
/mnt

Final Notes
Why Shift Targets by 1?
Language models predict the next token in the sequence. For input [tok1, tok2, tok3], the target is [tok2, tok3, tok4].

Dataset Compatibility:
With __len__ and __getitem__, you can now use DataLoader to batch and shuffle the data:

python
Copy
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
#############


#####lock file
#find . -name '*lck*' '*panic.log*'
#find . -name '*lck*' '*panic.log*' -exec rm {} +
find . \( -name '*lck*' -o -name '*panic.log*' \)
find . \( -name '*lck*' -o -name '*panic.log*' \) -exec rm {} +


####python related :
pip show torch (or package name)  ## this will show the deltails of the package where installed, which version etc....

##  this will show the path where the python is installed
import sys
print(sys.executable)
##

If the packages are installed but not in the path where the python is installed, then you have to append the path in your code like below :
##
import sys
sys.path.append('/path/where/the/package/installed')
##

5. Visualizing Compatibility
Imagine your dataset as a bookshelf:
__len__ tells the DataLoader how many books (samples) are on the shelf.
__getitem__ lets the DataLoader grab a specific book by its position.
The DataLoader acts like a librarian:
Shuffles the order of books (if asked).
Groups books into stacks (batch_size).
Hands these stacks to the model for training.

1. Why __len__ and __getitem__ Matter
PyTorchâ€™s Dataset class requires two core methods to work seamlessly with DataLoader:

__len__: Returns the total number of samples in the dataset.

__getitem__: Fetches a single sample (e.g., input and target) by index.

By defining these, your custom dataset becomes a standardized interface that DataLoader understands. Think of it like a checklist:

The DataLoader uses __len__ to know how many batches to create.

It uses __getitem__ to fetch individual samples and collate them into batches.

data_iter = iter(dataloader)  # Creates an iterator object. The iterator data_iter knows how to fetch batches sequentially from the dataloader.







ANALOG - OP-AMP 
Virtual short is valid until which point - Virtual short of the op-amp is valid until the output of the op-amp saturates (It doesnt follow the virtual ground once the output of the opamp saturates)
The virtual short condition is valid as long as the op-amp operates within its linear region. When the op-amp's output reaches its saturation point (i.e., it can no longer increase or decrease its output voltage), the virtual short condition no longer holds. In essence, the virtual short is dependent on the op-amp's ability to adjust its output to maintain the near-zero voltage difference between its inputs. Once it saturates, it loses this ability

Miller capacitance :
Any impedance connected connected between two nodes (say p and q) in a circuit can always be resolved into two impedences : one between p and GND, other between q and GND as long as there is a stringant relation between p and q at low frequences irrespective of the presence of the impedance between p and q. This means even though the impedance between p and q is absent, the relation between p and q still exists
Any impedance connected between two nodes (say p and q) in a circuit can always be resolved into two impedances: one between p and GND, and the other between q and GND, provided there is a strong relationship between the voltages at p and q at low frequencies, regardless of the presence of a direct impedance between p and q. This implies that even if the direct impedance between p and q is absent, the relationship between their voltages still exists.
